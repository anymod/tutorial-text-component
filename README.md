# Text web component tutorial

*This tutorial takes 5-10 minutes.*

### [Demo here](https://tutorial-text-component.herokuapp.com)

In this tutorial you will use a web component to render text on a webpage. Once the component is in place, you'll be able to edit the text without touching your code.

## Getting Started

There are 2 ways to view the file: by downloading or by cloning this repository.

##### Option A: direct download

Download the code as a .zip file using the above [![Clone or download](https://res.cloudinary.com/jframe/image/upload/v1484267460/clone_or_download.png)](https://github.com/jframedev/tutorial-text-component#) button. Unzip the package and view the web page by opening `index.html` with your browser.

##### Option B: `git clone` and run with node

* In your terminal window, run
```
git clone https://github.com/jframedev/tutorial-text-component.git
cd tutorial-text-component
npm install
npm start
```
* Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## The web page

We have a basic landing page that needs some content to describe the main product.

We could simply hard-code a description, but this is a great example of where the marketing team or a client might want to make changes later. So instead, we can use a jframe text component, which will make it easy to change the content later if we want.

Find the text in line 68 of `index.html`

```html
Need some content!
```
and replace it with the following
```html
<jframe text id="weddg"></jframe>
```

This jframe already has some text we can use. If you want to create your own jframe with your own content, you can [sign up for an account and create your own](https://jframe.io/auth/signup).

With the jframe component in place, we just need to paste the jframe snippet code onto the page. On line 218 of `index.html`, paste the snippet code:

```js
<!-- jframe snippet code -->
<script>
  (function(s,i,m,p,l,e,r){e=i.createElement(m),r=i.getElementsByTagName(m)[0],e.src=l+p+'.js',
  r.parentNode.insertBefore(e,r),s[p]=s[p]||{f:[],ready:function(c){s[p].f.push(c)}};
  })(window,document,'script','jframe','https://jfra.me/v0/');
</script>
```

Now when you reload the page, you get the content from the jframe.

It's that simple -- your component is working, and you can now edit its content in the jframe dashboard!

## Extra: behind the scenes

When the snippet code runs, it changes the jframe component from

```html
<jframe text id="weddg"></jframe>
```
to
```html
<div jframe text id="weddg">New Age is an app that will help you save time, money, or anything else!</div>
```
And because it's ultimately just HTML, you can style it however you want.
